# Tetris

**(This code is still in the [MVP stage](#mvp-stage))**

My clone of the Tetris game in Java.

## MVP Stage

This code is still in the MVP stage. This is verified by the fact that the latest commit is an MVP commit.

This means that the only the main purpose of this code has been implemented (in this case, only the main game).
No customization or menu options will be available.

There is no guarantee when(if it will) the code will move past the MVP stage and more functionality will be added.
Users may still encounter some bugs.
